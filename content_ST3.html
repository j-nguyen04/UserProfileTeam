          <h3>Overview of Life Below Water</h3>
          <p>Life Below Water was established in 2015 by the United Nations and explains about conserving and sustainably use of oceans, sea and marine resources in order to achieve sustainable development.

          <h1>Ocean Pollution</h1>
          <p>Ocean Pollution is one of the main threats to marine life and ecosystems. <br>Plastics end up in the ocean through various factors <br> such as littering, and poor waste management which contribute for the pollution. <br>Plastic items such as shopping bags, bottle caps and many more - they pose a threat <br>because it is long-lasting and so will take years to decompose</p>
          <p> Solutions against marine pollution include prevention and cleanup to reduce pollution  <br>from industrial and agricultural activities which can promote waste reduction, <br>raising public awareness of the impacts of ocean pollution. </p>

          <h2>Climate Change</h2>
          <p>Climate Change is affecting marine ecosystems such as ocean acidification. <br>Ocean acidification is caused by the ocean absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmostphere. <br> This can create conditions that eat away marine life such as oysters, clams, and lobsters.</p>
          <p>Scientists are monitoring and studying these causes through isotopic and other techniques to understand<br> how ocean acidification is posing a threat towards <br> marine life and other ecosystems and find alternatives to protect the ocean.</p>

          <h2>Overfishing</h2>
          <p>Overfishing is a global problem that threatens ocean wildlife and biodiversity.<br> Causing loss of marine life pose threats towards people who rely on marine life to gain protein. <br> 
          Overfishing occurs when too many fish are <br> caught to a point where adults cannot breed and sustain a healthy population.</p>
          <p>The level of overfishing has increased and the number of overfished stocks is three times higher than in 1970. <br>Studies from United Nations have monitored around 500 stocks of fish around the globe and in 2022,<br> and is estimated more than a third of global fish stocks are overfished</p>

          <h2>Coastal Eutrophication</h2>
          <p>Eutrophication is caused by excessive plant and algae growth due to increased availability <br> of one or more limiting growth factors to achieve photosynthesis. <br>
          This creates problems, including dead zones reducing fish and shellfish production. <br>Harmful algae blooms that form taste and odor problems - this threatens the safety of drinking water supplies.
          <p>Ways to mitigate against eutrophication could reduce the input of nitrogren and <br> phosphorus into coastal waters from industrial and agricultural sources. <br> they could also encourage sustainable agricultural practices to reduce nutrient run off and soil erosion</p>
